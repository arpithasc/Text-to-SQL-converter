# Advanced Text-to-SQL Query Generation using Large Language Models

This project investigates the integration of cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the process of translating natural language queries into executable SQL commands. This work explores methodologies to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of Text-to-SQL generation.

## Project Overview

The core objective of this project is to address the inherent challenges in accurately converting human language questions into precise SQL queries. By leveraging the advanced understanding and generation capabilities of modern LLMs, this research aims to create a more intuitive and effective way for users to interact with databases.

## Methodology

The implemented methodology involves a multi-stage process designed to optimize the translation of natural language to SQL:

1.  **Natural Language Input:** The system accepts natural language queries as the primary input.
2.  **Semantic Embedding:** Input queries are transformed into dense vector embeddings using pre-trained models to capture their semantic meaning.
3.  **Contextual Retrieval:** These query embeddings are compared against a vector store containing embeddings of relevant data or database context.
4.  **LLM-Enhanced Understanding:** Retrieved contextual information, along with the original query embedding, is fed into the LLM with specialized prompts designed to enhance its understanding of the query's intent within the data context.
5.  **Iterative Refinement (Optional):** The LLM may generate an intermediate response to clarify ambiguities or refine the initial query before SQL generation.
6.  **SQL Synthesis:** The refined query and the database schema are provided to the LLM with prompts specifically tailored for SQL code generation.
7.  **Query Validation:** Generated SQL queries undergo a rigorous validation process to ensure syntactic correctness, adherence to the database schema, and to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
8.  **Output and Execution:** Upon successful validation, the resulting SQL query is either presented to the user or executed directly against the target database.
9.  **Feedback Mechanism (Potential):** A feedback loop can be incorporated to further refine the query generation process based on validation outcomes or user input.
