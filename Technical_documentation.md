## 🧩 Project Overview

The Text-to-SQL Query Generator is a lightweight AI tool designed to translate natural language questions into valid SQL queries. Built for non-technical users, this system eliminates the need for writing complex database queries by using language models, vector similarity, and prompt engineering techniques to automate SQL generation.


## 🎯 Purpose

Enable analysts, marketers, and managers to:
	•	Retrieve data from structured databases using plain English
	•	Interact with databases without learning SQL
	•	Increase productivity and reduce dependency on technical teams


## 💡 Key Features
	•	🔄 Converts natural language → SQL in real-time
	•	🧠 Uses LLMs & vector embeddings for intelligent query mapping
	•	⚡ Fast, accurate results on any SQL-compatible database
	•	🔒 Modular & secure – customizable to private datasets

 ## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Technology              Usage
Python                  Backend scripting
FAISS                   Vector similarity search
SentenceTransformers    Query embedding
LangChain / OpenAI API  LLM-based SQL generation
SQLite                  Sample database
Streamlit               Web interface

START
  ↓
Receive User Input (Plain English)
  ↓
Run NLP Model → Extract Intents & Entities
  ↓
Map Entities to DB Schema (Table, Column)
  ↓
Generate SQL Query

(OPTIONAL) Execute Query on DB
  ↓
Return SQL / Results

END

## 🔍 How It Works
[User Input] → “Show top 10 orders by value”

→ Text is converted into vector form (embedding)  
→ Matching context retrieved from schema using FAISS  
→ SQL prompt formed and passed to LLM  
→ LLM returns valid SQL → Executed → Results shown

## 🧪 Example Inputs & Outputs
Natural Language Input                    Generated SQL Query
“List all customers from Bangalore”       SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'Bangalore';
“Total revenue generated in May 2025”     SELECT SUM(amount) FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2025-05-01' AND '2025-05-

## 🚫 Limitations
	•	Accuracy depends on clarity of input and LLM behavior
	•	Complex nested queries may need manual validation
	•	Currently supports SELECT-type queries 


## 🚀 Future Enhancements
	•	🔍 Schema visualizer for better context understanding
	•	🧾 Voice input using speech-to-text for natural UX
	•	🧠 Model fine-tuning for domain-specific SQL dialects
